# Installation

## Wally (Recommended)

1. Install [Wally](https://wally.run/). We recommend using [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) for this task.
2. Initialize a new Wally package by running `wally init`.
3. Include `object-pool` as a dependency in your `wally.toml` file, like so:
```toml
ObjectPool = "frqstbite/object-pool@x.x.x"
```
4. Run `wally install`.

## Manual

1. Download `object-pool.rbxm` from the [latest release](https://github.com/frqstbite/object-pool/releases/latest).
2. Sync in with [Rojo](https://rojo.space) or import into Roblox Studio manually.
